# Rescript React Boilerplate

An opinionated implementation of the following technologies:

- ReScript & React
- Simple routing using [ReScript's built in router](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/react/latest/router)
- Emotion for CSS-in-JS (or check our the [Sass branch](https://github.com/persianturtle/rescript-react-boilerplate/tree/sass))
- Quick and dirty route transitions via [ReactTransitionGroup](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group)
- [http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server) for a quick and easy development server
- [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for fast bundling
- Automatically generated [ServiceWorker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker) for rich offline experiences (here's a great [in-depth course on the topic](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud899))

## Development Environment

Since we're using ReScript and esbuild, our build times are fast.

Because of this, we use [chokidar (a cross-platform file watcher)](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) to watch for changes and then rebuild the `dist` directory on every change. The `dist` directory is the same whether in development or in production.

The build should work on macOS, Windows & Linux.
